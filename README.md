# Hello My Friend

At the end of oAuth2, which I have been researching and reading for a long time, I finally found the way to connect with discord and get information, that's how I did it. If I'm wrong, feel free to email me so I can correct it.

# Infrastructure

Exchange with Discord user's data with PHP

---

## How To Use?

### 1. Install index.php.

Download the index.oho file, put it in the source file in your project.

### 2. And Run

Include in your page with import or script and access all commands, WoW

---

## Important

```php
	define('OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID', '');//CLIENT ID
	define('OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET', '');//CLIENT SECRET
```
Fill in the blanks with your own oAuth 2!
